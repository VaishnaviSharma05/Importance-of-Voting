        <h2>Why Voting Matters</h2>
        <h3>Voting is one of the most powerful tools you have to shape the world around you. It's more than just a civic dutyâ€”it's an essential part of democracy and a way for you to make an impact on society. When you vote, you influence government policies, laws, and decisions that affect everything from healthcare and education to the economy and the environment.</h3>

        <h2>Key Reasons to Vote</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>
            Voting refers to the process of choosing officials or policies by casting a ballot, a document used by people to formally express their preferences. Republics and representative democracies are governments where the population chooses representatives by voting.

The procedure for identifying the winners based on votes varies depending on both the country and the political office. Political scientists call these procedures electoral systems, while mathematicians and economists call them social choice rules. The study of these rules and what makes them good or bad is the subject of a branch of welfare economics known as social choice theory.
